## Featured Projects

### [Mitigating Scene Bias in Video Recognition](https://github.com/swabhipapneja/MitigatingSceneBias)
> PyTorch, ResNet-18, 3D CNNs  
Trained on 80K+ Mini-Kinetics videos to reduce scene bias in action recognition using dual loss functions. Improved accuracy by 2.66% over baseline across multiple benchmarks.

### [Counterhate Arguments for Online Hate Speech](https://github.com/swabhipapneja/CounterhateArguments)
> Huggingface Transformers, PyTorch  
Built a multilingual NLP model for detecting authentic counterhate responses with 96% precision. Scaled to 10+ languages using RoBERTa and LongFormer.

### [Review Radar - ML-Powered Product Review Analysis](https://github.com/swabhipapneja/ReviewRadar)
> React, FastAPI, Transformers, MongoDB, Redis, AWS  
End-to-end app for sentiment analysis and keyword extraction from e-commerce reviews using fine-tuned DistilBERT and RoBERTa.

### [Reinforcement Learning for Atari Bowling](https://github.com/swabhipapneja/Atari-Bowling-RL)
> DQN/DDQN, PyTorch, OpenAI Gym  
Designed CNN-based Q-learning agents using DQN and DDQN. Achieved mean rewards of 75.25 and 73.06.
